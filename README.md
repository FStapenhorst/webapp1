# Demo project: issue creating a delegate

- Open the WebApplication2.sln
- Run the application
- In the Browser, run the WheatherForecast demo (click the Try Out button and then Execute)

You'll see the exception in the class WeatherForecastController, in CreateDelegate() line 42.
The delegate type is correct but still the exception is thrown.
